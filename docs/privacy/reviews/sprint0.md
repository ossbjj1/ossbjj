## Summary
Sprint 0 establishes Flutter app structure with no PII handling yet. No user data flows exist.

- No auth, no analytics, no tracking
- No Supabase connection in code

## Consent
- **N/A** – No data collection in Sprint 0
- Consent screens planned for Sprint 2

## Storage
- **None** – No local or remote persistence

## Third Parties
- **None** – No analytics/Sentry in Sprint 0

## RLS

## Retention
- **N/A** – No data to retain

## User Rights

## Compliance
✅ **MIWF compliant** – Engine runs "naked" (no data), consent-first design baked into WARP.md
